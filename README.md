This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and its interaction with empty strings.  The provided code highlights the unexpected behavior and offers a solution to avoid it.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with user input or data from external sources where an empty string might represent a missing or invalid value, but `IsEmpty` fails to identify it correctly.
